  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo and project_state.json, but none of the requirements (REQ-27, REQ-28, REQ-29) are implemented. REQ-27 requires running 'dfx generate telemetry' and generating declaration files, REQ-28 requires correcting the import path in useActor.ts, and REQ-29 requires triggering a rebuild. The diff contains no evidence of declaration file generation, no modifications to useActor.ts, and no build artifacts or configuration changes related to the telemetry declarations.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Run the terminal command 'dfx generate telemetry' (or platform equivalent) to generate TypeScript declarations for the telemetry canister",

      "requirement": "Trigger a rebuild after declarations are generated and import paths are verified",
