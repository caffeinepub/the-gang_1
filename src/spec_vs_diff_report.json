  "summary": "The diff shows that REQ-1 is fully implemented (agents map changed from 'let' to 'var'), but REQ-2 is only partially implemented. The toggleAgentStatus function uses 'agents.add()' instead of the requested 'agents := agents.put()' or equivalent reassignment syntax. While 'agents.add()' may mutate the map in place, the requirement explicitly requested reassignment syntax, which is not present.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Explicitly reassign the updated map to the agents state variable using 'agents := agents.put(agent.id, updatedAgent);' or equivalent syntax for the Map library",
      "reason": "The toggleAgentStatus function uses 'agents.add(agent.id, updatedAgent);' instead of the explicitly requested reassignment pattern 'agents := agents.put(...)'. While this may work functionally, it does not match the specific implementation requirement.",
