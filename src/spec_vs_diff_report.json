  "summary": "The diff shows implementation of REQ-136, REQ-137, REQ-138, and REQ-139 by removing cross-canister call logic and stubbing the debate function with hardcoded responses. However, the backend/main.mo diff is severely truncated, preventing full verification of all acceptance criteria. Frontend changes include a comment acknowledging the backend now returns hardcoded responses, which aligns with the requirements but was explicitly excluded from scope (non-goal: 'Do not modify frontend files').",

      "id": "REQ-136",
      "requirement": "Complete removal of all cross-canister call logic including await agent.askAgent(...) calls, Actor lookups, and Principal ID references in start_boardroom_debate",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo diff is truncated and does not show the start_boardroom_debate function implementation, making it impossible to verify that all await statements, Actor.createActor calls, and Principal ID lookups have been removed",

      "reason": "The backend/main.mo diff is truncated before showing the start_boardroom_debate function body, so the hardcoded response format cannot be verified",
