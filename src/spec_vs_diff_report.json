  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all three requirements: REQ-129 adds try/catch/finally error handling around the backend call in App.tsx, REQ-130 clears the transcript at the start of speech recording in useSpeechRecognition.ts, and REQ-131 removes registry checks from backend/main.mo. However, the transcript clearing location differs from the specification, which requested it in handlePushToTalk.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-130",
      "requirement": "Add setTranscript([]) as the very first line of the handlePushToTalk function in frontend/src/App.tsx or the component containing handlePushToTalk",
      "reason": "The transcript clearing was implemented in useSpeechRecognition.ts startListening() function instead of in the handlePushToTalk function. While functionally similar, this does not match the exact specification requiring it in handlePushToTalk or the component containing that function.",
