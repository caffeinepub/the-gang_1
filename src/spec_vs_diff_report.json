  "summary": "The diff shows that REQ-1 has been implemented (using agents.remove() + agents.add() pattern in toggleAgentStatus), but REQ-2 is missing entirely. The diff provides no evidence of AccessControl trap removal from any functions. Additionally, the code still imports and initializes AccessControl modules, suggesting authentication barriers remain in place.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Remove all AccessControl trap blocks from every function including toggleAgentStatus, start_boardroom_debate, getStatus, and any other functions. Delete every if (not (AccessControl...)) { Runtime.trap(...) } statement to allow functions to execute without authentication checks.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no removal of AccessControl imports, initialization, or trap blocks. The code still includes 'import AccessControl', 'let accessControlState = AccessControl.initState()', and 'include MixinAuthorization(accessControlState)'. No evidence of Runtime.trap() removal is visible in the truncated functions (toggleAgentStatus, getStatus, start_boardroom_debate).",
