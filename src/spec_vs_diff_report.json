  "summary": "The diff successfully implements all four requirements. REQ-84 removes the Principal input field and state, REQ-85 removes Principal validation from the upload button, REQ-86 implements chunked upload via The_Orchestrator's upload_chunk function with sequential 1.8MB chunks, and REQ-87 calls route_document with filename and preview text after upload completion.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added fileSize parameter to routeDocument function call in useRouteDocument hook",
      "reason": "REQ-87 specifies route_document should be called with exactly two parameters: file.name and previewText (first 5,000 characters). The implementation adds a third parameter 'fileSize: bigint' and a fourth parameter 'sensoryCortexPrincipal' which were not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "description": "Added sensoryCortexPrincipal parameter with placeholder Principal to routeDocument",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states to route operations through The_Orchestrator backend without additional Principal parameters. The constraint 'Route all file operations through The_Orchestrator backend, not directly to Sensory Cortex' suggests the backend should handle Principal resolution internally, not receive it from the frontend.",
