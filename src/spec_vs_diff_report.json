  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-140 (React infinite loop fix) and REQ-141 (hardcoded backend response). REQ-140 is partially addressed through polling interval adjustments in useQueries.ts. REQ-141 appears implemented in backend/main.mo but the diff is truncated, preventing full verification of the exact function body.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-140",
      "requirement": "Move all state setter calls from render body to explicit event handlers or useEffect with proper dependency arrays in App.tsx",
      "reason": "The diff does not include App.tsx changes. Only useQueries.ts shows polling interval adjustments (reduced from 500ms to 3000ms), which addresses symptoms but not the root cause of state setters in render body.",
