          "description": "Locate the Boardroom component render body and all useEffect hooks. Identify any state setter calls (setTranscript, setIsDebating, setIsRecording, or similar) that are being executed directly in the render body or inside a useEffect without a proper dependency array. Move all state updates to explicit event handlers (onClick, onSubmit, etc.) or wrap them in useEffect with strict dependency arrays like [] or [specificDependency]. Ensure no state setters are called in the main render flow outside of event handlers or properly configured useEffect hooks."
