  "summary": "Multi-agent AI system 'The Gang' deployed on Internet Computer with 10 canisters: The_Orchestrator (main backend), 8 AI agent canisters (Robby, Skippy, The Architect, Deep Thought, GLaDOS, V.I.N.CENT, Janet, The Librarian), and Sensory_Cortex (document routing). Frontend has three tabs: Boardroom (debates), Sensory Cortex (file upload), and Swarm Health (agent monitoring). Uses chunked 1.8MB file uploads with StableBTreeMap storage. Wasm64 architecture with 6GB heap. Implementing Option 2 cycle management (Agents Self-Sustaining) where Deep Thought (The Accountant) monitors all 9 system canisters and auto-tops up when balances drop below 2T cycles.",
